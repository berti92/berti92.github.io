    <h1>Dear "10x" devs I'm tired, I'm so fucking tired</h1>

    <p>I'm tired, that...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have to read your fucking "genius" code, where you packed my 10 line if into a oneliner and now I need 15 minutes to
        understand your marvelous code.</li>
        <li>I have to spend days to implement your PR feedback, which are mostly things like naming. And surely you don't give me
        feedback once, it is a back and forth over days combined with arguing why I did things and why not.</li>
        <li>I have to fix the bug that you produced, because you refactored a function which is 15 years old and worked perfectly
        until now.</li>
        <li>I have to wait days for your approval of my PR which I needed yesterday, but you need time to review my changes I did
        to tests.</li>
        <li>you heavily argue to wont adding a crucial feature for the customer, because there is no good way to write "clean"
        code for that.</li>
        <li>you wont write documentation, because the code is the documentation. Just fuck you! We all know, what you are trying
        to achieve, you are trying to save your ass and be unreplacable to your employer. But guess what, no employeer in this
        world would just give a single fuck about you. You will be always replaced. You only make the life of your coworkers
        harder.</li>
