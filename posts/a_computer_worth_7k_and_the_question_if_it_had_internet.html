    <h1>A computer worth 7k$ and the question if it had internet</h1>
    <small>2025-06-23 12:11 CEST</small>
    <p>
        Shortly after I successfully ended my apprenticeship as an office worker, I was fired because the company had some rough
        times and was bought by another company. We all juniors were fired on the spot when the new CEO came to power. At this
        time, as an office worker, it was really hard to get a new job, and to be honest, I didn't really like the job. So I
        searched for new opportunities. At some day, my mother gave me the daily newspaper and went like "Maybe you want to try
        this". It was a job offering from a small company at "Grünwald". It's a bit like the Hollywood of Bavaria. It's a small
        town near Munich, where many film studios are located. The offering went like "Learn video cutting and build video
        cutting systems". This sounded so cool, and I had not really that choice, so I applied for the job and landed it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The payment was terrible, but I had a job, and the job itself was very fun. At first, I got a brief introduction to
        video cutting, and then I did a bootcamp for the video cutting software. In fact, even to this day, I'm listed as a
        certified video cutter on their website ^^
    </p>
<p>
    Shortly I and my boss noticed that I'm not a good video cutter, so I was offered to try to build the video cutting
    systems. These systems were only standard ATX computers with powerful hardware. And that was spot on. I was so good and
    fast at this field. And it was incredibly fun to build these systems. Imagine I was a very young guy in a small room
    with one long table on the right side, and on the left side was a long shelf with all the hardware I needed to build the
    computer. CPU, RAM, case - you name it.
    <br>
    In this room were only two people, my supervisor and me. We liked each other, talked shit the whole day while building
    computers, installing software, and testing them. It was a great time.
</p>
<p>
    The workflow was simple. We had a small tray with letters in it. Every time one of us had finished a built, then we
    moved the built to the logistics section, walked back into our room, and picked a new letter (=order) out of this tray.
    It included which hardware the computer should include, which software should be installed, and so on.
    This order also included the sale price of the build. Nearly every computer was around 1 to 2 thousand euros. So they
    were not cheap.
</p>
<p>
    That was the intro... Now to the real story...
</p>
<p>
    I picked a new order and read that the sell price of the build was about 6.5 thousand euros. I went immediately - what
    the fuck?! I headed to the sales guy and asked if it was a real order. He went like, Yeah, that's a real order and
    smiled. He even configured the best CPU - at the time, the Intel i7 Extreme Edition.<br>
    I was thrilled to build this computer the finest hardware, completely maxed out and custom work to do, like installing
    specific software. It was the best week I had at this company, it was so much fun, and every piece of hardware I touched
    with precision and care about that system. After completion of the build I read that the customer also maxed out the
    software. He ordered Adobe software, EDIUS, Premiere, and much other software we offered to install. I think the
    software alone was worth about 1.5 thousand euros. Keep in mind, this customer ticked every box we offered to build a
    computer back in 2011.
</p>
<p>
    The day came. I finished this computer and brought it to the logistics section. After a few days, the sales guy called
    me and went like "The guy with the expensive computer. You know that system, do you? He comes tomorrow and pick up the
    computer. He wants to speak with you about that system. Is that okay for you?". I went fuck yeah. I want to meet this
    guy. At home, I googled everything about that hardware to be informed when the guy shows up. So I drove the next day to
    my workplace and waited until the guy showed up. I didn't start work until I saw this guy. I was just googling again for
    hardware info.
</p>
<p>
    Then my phone rang. "He is here. Do you come over?". I ran out our "building" room along the floor. And then I saw him.
    It was a REALLY old guy. In fact, he looked so old that I thought he could die any minute. The sales guy introduced each
    other. And I started talking and praising how good this system is. He stopped me after a few sentences and asked me.
    "Kann der auch Internet?" Translated to English, it means "Does it have internet?". My world collapsed. I asked, What do
    you mean with that? "Can I use Google with it?". At that moment, my whole worldview was fucked. I couldn't say a word
    for a few seconds. I stumbled and went. "Who configured this computer? Did you order it?". The next conversation was so
    sad. He went, "My grandson configured it. He needs a new computer for school, and I wanted to help him so that he can do
    his homework." Now I wasn't sad anymore; now I was angry as fuck. This little fucker burned 6.5 thousand euros of his
    grandpa to just have the "best" computer. This little son of a bitch even ordered software he probably never needs for
    another 1.5 thousand euros. I was done. I told him: "This is the BEST computer you can buy. You can do everything with
    it. There is nothing better than this computer." He answered, "I'm happy to hear that, my grandson will love it.".
</p>
<p>
    And now it was one of my worst days. I know that this little fucker, aka grandson, lied to his grandpa, and he burned
    many thousand euros on that computer. At that time, I was really struggling to get money, and I thought this grandpa
    maybe had not that much money either. Maybe he needed to work for this amount for many months or even years to save it?!
    I couldn't tell him the truth, too. Man, this was so fucked up. Keep in mind, my current car at that time costed me 1.5
    thousand euros. And with that, I drive every day to work with it... We all know that this computer was only used to play
    Minecraft.
</p>
<p>
    EDIT: Because some friends asked me about it. The grandpa wasn't dressed well and didn't drive a nice car. It was an
    <b>older</b>, completely standard Volkswagen Passat station wagon. In fact, my grandpa drove the same Passat.
