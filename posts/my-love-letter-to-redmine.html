    <h1>My Love Letter to Redmine</h1>
    <small>2025-03-13 17:20 CEST</small>
    <p>
      After over a decade in software development, I’ve worked with countless project management tools. I’ve tried almost
      everything: Bugzilla, Jira, Mantis, OpenProject, Monday (formerly known as Dapulse), Trello, Redmine, and many more.
    </p>
    <p>Redmine was love at first sight. It’s a tool that simply works as expect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Want to centralize customer communication?</strong>&nbsp;Just set up a mailbox and import emails directly into tickets.</li>
      <li><strong>Need to close tickets via Git commit messages?</strong>&nbsp;Simply configure the repository settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-link tickets to mark duplicates?</strong>&nbsp;Done.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan feature releases?</strong>&nbsp;Easy.</li>
      <li><strong>Communicate with customers directly?</strong>&nbsp;It’s possible out-of-the-box, or you can supercharge it with plugins like the
      <a href="https://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_contacts_helpdesk">Helpdesk Plugin</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most of the features mentioned above are very simple, and many project trackers support them. But Redmine does them
      exceptionally well.
    </p>
    <p>If you’re unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> and check out its <a href="https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Features">screenshots</a>, there’s a good chance you’ll think, “This looks ugly as
    fuck — I’d never use it!” But hold on. A project management tool or issue tracker is something you’ll use EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
    You need something that works.</p>
    <p>Most tools today try to reinvent Excel. Take OpenProject (which is built on Redmine’s framework) or Monday.com: click on an
    issue title in a list, and it turns into an editable text field. My first thought was: "WTF?!"... Seriously, think about it — how often do you actually
    rename an issue? Almost never. So why include this “feature”? To me, it’s pure BS and shows how
    out-of-touch the planners of these tools are with real user needs.</p>
    <p>So ask yourself: Do you want a flashy new tool, or one that’s been reliably working for decades?</p>
    <p>Of course, no tool is flawless. Redmines calendar, for example, is painfully bad — it’s just a static overview with no
    drag-and-drop functionality. But here’s the deal: Redmine is open source. If something doesn’t fit for you, build your
    own solution. <a href="https://www.redmine.org/plugins/mega_calendar">I did exactly that</a> with a custom calendar plugin Redmine feels now complete.</p>
    <p>If you’re shopping for project management tools, <strong>definitely</strong> give Redmine a shot. Set it up on your own hardware, avoid
    subscription costs, and future-proof your workflow. It’s the no-nonsense workhorse that gets the job done.</p>
